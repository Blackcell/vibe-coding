# Vibecoding Lesson 1 - Bouncing Sphere Animation

## Problem Statement

Please write a JavaScript app in an effects window that animates a bouncing red sphere. The animation should include:

1. **Bouncing Red Sphere**: A red sphere that moves and bounces around the window
2. **Trail Effect**: Leave a visual trail behind the sphere as it moves
3. **Gravity**: Apply realistic gravity physics to pull the sphere downward
4. **Energy Transfer**: When the sphere hits the floor, it should bounce back with energy (but potentially lose some energy over time for realism)

## Requirements

- Use HTML5 Canvas for rendering
- Implement proper physics simulation
- Create smooth animation with visual trail effects
- Handle boundary collisions (especially floor bouncing)
- Make the animation visually appealing

## Files

- `index.html` - Main HTML file with canvas element
- `app.js` - JavaScript animation logic
- `styles.css` - Styling for the animation window
